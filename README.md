## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript 5 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui (New York) |
| Database | Prisma ORM + SQLite (local) / MongoDB Atlas (production) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ / Bun
- An M3U playlist URL (or use the seeded demo playlists from iptv-org)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set up the database
bun run db:push

# Start the dev server
bun run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` — the platform auto-seeds 3 demo IPTV playlists and the category hierarchy on first load.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./db/custom.db"
```

For production with MongoDB Atlas:
```env
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/stream2arena"
